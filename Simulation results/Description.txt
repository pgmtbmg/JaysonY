The ¡°Simulation figure¡±file only retains the experimental group that detected the error.

	Simulation result file name£º	num represent a simulation sequence
		num_2              Indicates the contrast before and after the width threshold setting of the wavelet packet after the second decomposition
		numd               Indicates the result of the multi-threshold method detection
		numq               Represents the result of a wavelet packet transform from one to five times (double-threshold)
		nums                Indicates the result of the double threshold method detection
		numy                Represents the original signal map of the synthesis
	Statistical results:
		"0" means the test result is correct
		"1" indicates that the test result is incorrect (missing and false positive)


The¡°Simulation result statistics¡±file is the statistics of the simulation results.
